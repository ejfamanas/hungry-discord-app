Discord App for Hungry Guy

Install the following on your machine:
- git
- npm
- nodejs
- tsc
- ts-node

Before continuing you will need to set up a github account.
Add an ssh key to your github account (recommended).



After everything is installed:
- get the copy link from the clone button on this repo
- in a command line, run "git clone (copy-paste the link here)"
- in a command line, run "npm install" (this will install all the dependencies)

To run:
- for now, in a command line, run "npm run dev" and that will run the output of index.ts
